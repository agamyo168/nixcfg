## Folder Structure

I've structured my files based on what I've seen as popular way to organize your nix configs and also what seems more modular.

- `homeManagerModules/` -> Modules that I use for home-manager
- `homes/` -> My home manager profiles
- `hosts/` -> My personal laptop, local server and work laptop (soon)
- `nixosModules/` -> Services and DE that cannot run by home-manager

## Profiles

- `perry` -> My personal laptop
- `sunny` -> local server for self-hosting
- `darwin` -> my work computer (Not included yet)
